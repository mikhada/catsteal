# Operation Cat-Steal
## This is just a test repo
Seriously, this is just a goofy little test program in a test repo I'm using for testing language and GitHub features and integrations.
Sometimes, there will be intentionally bad code pushed to the repository to test certain things. Nothing in here is to be taken seriously and is not recommended for use by anyone.
